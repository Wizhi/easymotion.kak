https://github.com/alexherbo2/plug.kak for installing.

---
plug easymotion https://git.sr.ht/~voroskoi/easymotion.kak
---

== Setup

easymotion.kak does _not_ set up any mapping by default, however here are some
recommendations:

NOTE: The `<space>` after the `:` is not accidental, this way pressing those keys
will not pollute Your command history.

Using the easymotion user mode:

---
require-module easymotion
map global normal <Å±> ': enter-user-mode easymotion<ret>'
---

Or using direcly by remapping some Kakaoune keys:

---
require-module easymotion
map global normal <j> ': easymotion-f<ret>'
map global normal <k> ': easymotion-k<ret>'
map global normal <w> ': easymotion-w<ret>'
map global normal <b> ': easymotion-b<ret>'
---

== Options

This plugin provides the follwing options:
*easymotion_chars*::
    A character string for specifying keys used for generation jump
highlighters. This should be on the home row of your default keymap.

NOTE: This sting should be long enough (20 chars) othervise there will be no enough key
option for generating!

== Usage

Start an easymotion-command with a mapping or from the prompt. The plugin will
highlight the jumping options.
Take Your prefered jumping option by typing in those two letters and hit <ret>
for executing the movement.
